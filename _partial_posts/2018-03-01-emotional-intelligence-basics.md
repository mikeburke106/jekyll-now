title: Emotional Intelligence Basics
---

One of my most popular and requested tech talks is called [Emotional Intelligence At Work](/files/Emotional-Intelligence-At-Work.pdf).  Emotional and social skills are more than 4x more important than IQ when it comes to professional success.  So, let's talk about the very basics of emotional intelligence and how you can apply these principles in your daily life.

## What is Emotional Intelligence?

Definitions vary widely, but emotional intelligence is basically the degree to which you understand and can control your emotions and the emotions of those around you.  Unlike IQ, emotional intelligence can be taught, learned and improved with practice.  Emotional intelligence is a skill that can be developed.

### Quick Biology Lesson

From a biological perspective, there are really two different parts of the brain that can cause us to take action - the amygdala and the cerebral cortex.  I'm currently reading [*Thinking, Fast and Slow*](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555) by Daniel Kahneman, which goes into excrutiating detail about how these two "systems" of thinking work together, work against each other, and how each system can be manipulated in various ways.  This is a great book to ponder while developing your self-awareness.

#### Amygdala

The [amygdala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala) part of the brain - sometimes referred to as the "lizard brain" - was developed long before the cerebral cortex and was developed as a way to make quick, impulse decisions.  The more quickly danger could be recognized and avoided, the more likely we were to survive in the wild, surrounded by constant danger.

When our ancient ancestors saw some leaves moving in their periferal vision, they noticed it very quickly - is that a tiger trying to kill us!?  Quick!  Run away from the danger!

If I were to throw a ball at your face and get your attention, you would likely swat it away at the last second without even thinking about it (if you have a slow amygdala, I apologize in advance for the black eye).

The decisions to take the aforementioned actions are determined purely by the amygdala.  There is no logical or rational thought involved in amygdala decisions; the amygdala is impulsive, emotional and extremely fast to action, even if that action is not logical or rational.

#### Cerebral Cortex

The [cerebral cortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex), on the other hand, is the logic center of the brain and is responsible for processing information in order to determine a logical and rational course of action.  If I ask you to calculate 48 times 14 in your head, you will likely have to think about it for several seconds, at least, to come up with an answer.  This is your slow cerebral cortex processing information to come up with a desired conclusion.  The answer is 672, by the way.

Could you imagine if the cerebral cortex had to process information about a ball flying towards your face before making the decision to swat it out of the air?  You'd be hit in the face while your cerebral cortex tried to calculate the velocity of the ball.  We likely would not be here today without the "lizard brain" amygdala reaction to danger.

Could you imagine not being able to process any logic whatsoever?  Our massive societies and great accomplishments as a species would never have come to be; we would still be killing each other in the jungles and fighting for survival every second of our lives.  We definitely would not be here today without the cerebral cortex reaction.

The amygdala and cerebral cortex work together every second of our lives.  However, since the amygdala is so much faster than the cerebral cortex, we have a tendency to make impulsive, emotional decisions based on that amygdala response.  By the time the necessary information makes it to the cerebral cortex, we recognize the error of our response and feel remorseful for the impulsive action.

Now that we have a basic understanding of the parts of our brain at work, let's talk about the 4 basic principles of emotional intelligence:

## 1. Self-Awareness

> *Socrates*

If you learn anything from reading this, I want you to understand this concept.  Self-awareness is a fundamental condition that makes being human so great.  Without self-awareness, we would be nothing more than the plants in the ground or the water filling the oceans - we would simply exist and that would be all our so-called lives had to offer.

Luckily, we are self-aware and, even more luckily, self-awareness can be honed and improved with dedication and practice.

So, what exactly do I mean by self-awareness?  In this context, self-awareness means being aware of your current emotional state throughout your daily life and making time to reflect and introspect on those emotional states.

You may believe you're already aware of your emotional state, but are you really?  When you're in an irritable mood, do you recognize it before you act on it?  Or is it the action that made you aware of the emotion?  Think of the last time you "lost control" of your emotions - maybe it was yelling at someone, maybe it was breaking down crying, or maybe it was laying in bed all day with no desire to get up.  If you became aware of the underlying emotions sooner, you could have processed those emotions in your cerebral cortex (the logical part of the brain) before you made an impulsive action.

### Practice

How do we practice self-awareness and enhance this skill?  Start with the practice of mindful meditation.  There are many types of meditation; mindful meditation is a type of meditation where you focus on breathing, but you will inevitably be distracted by your brain.  When a distraction happens, recognize, without judgement, what thoughts are distracting you from your goal.  These same thoughts are probably distracting you and affecting your emotions throughout your daily life.

As you continue to practice mindful meditation, you will start noticing your thoughts more regularly and more quickly.  This gives you more time to send those thoughts through your cerebral cortex and make a logical decision in regards to whether those thoughts are helping you or hindering you and take appropriate action.

You should not only understand your emotions, but the reason behind them as well.  Once you understand what you're feeling, try to understand why you're feeling that way.  If you notice you're angry - why are you angry?  If you can control whatever it is that makes you angry, you should do what you can to take it out of your life.  If you can't control the environment, your only choice is to control the emotional reaction to it.
