title: Importance of a Morning Ritual
---

An effective day starts with an effective morning ritual; one that not only helps you get out of bed in the morning but one that makes you feel **excited** to get out of bed in the morning.

I've been doing a morning ritual for about 2 months now.  In fact, writing this blog post is part of my morning ritual.  I pack the first hour and a half of my day with things that are important to me, but that I frequently make excuses not to do.

Tracking the first part of your day gets a cadence going and helps you stay on track for the rest of the day, so I track each activity down to the minute.

Here's my current morning routine:

| Duration | Activity |
| -------- |:--------:|
| 10m | Brush teeth, drink water |
| 15m | Exercise |
| 5m  | Meditation |
| 15m | Creative outlet |
| 10m | Innovation brainstorming |
| 5m  | Affirmations |
| 5m  | Visualization |
| 10m | Plan the day |
| 15m | Reading |

After my 5 a.m. alarm rings and I'm laying there debating whether to get up or hit snooze, I think about these activities that I really enjoy doing and how much better my day is going to be if I get up and do it.  The internal debate is over in an instant as I turn off the alarm and excitedly get out of bed.

My 2 favorite parts of the morning routine are alotted the biggest chunk of time: creative outlet & reading.

## Creative Outlet

Creativity is one of my core values and I make time to create something every morning.  I'll make a blog post, a short story, a song or a drawing - anything that makes me feel creative.  This gives my very structured morning routine some flexibility and keeps me excited.  Maybe today I just want to draw a picture on the whiteboard or maybe I'm inspired for something bigger; as long as it's creative, I have time to work on it!

## Reading

I really enjoy reading, which is why it's at the end of the morning routine.  Reading is my reward for staying on track and accomplishing so much in the morning routine.  Sometimes I'll read a fiction book, but many times I'll read books about improv, business, team dynamics, personal improvment, etc.

The information that goes into your brain every day is what sets up your internal mindsets, so reading books that get you pumped and excited for life are going to keep you in a positive, excited mindset.  Conversely, watching the news or reading articles about bad things happening in the world is going to drag you down.  Keep your world positive by controlling the inputs to your brain.

## Conclusion

My morning routine has been a catalyst for change in my life.  I'm learning more than ever, I'm creating more than ever, I'm more focused than ever.  Best of all, I've lost over 15 pounds in 2 months due to the consistency of exercise and daily focus on eating healthy foods.

You can do it, too!  It starts this morning.
