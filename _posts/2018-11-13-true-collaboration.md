title: True Collaboration
---

Collaboration doesn't mean "working together". Collaboration means "helping each other succeed".

Collaboration is one of my favorite topics because I know from experience that a high functioning team can accomplish incredible things.

Many of us hear "collaboration" and just think, "Yeah, yeah, we're working on something together," but I suggest it's much deeper than that.

### True Collaboration
Collaboration means sacrificing your needs for the needs of the team. The team comes first and it's your responsibility to do whatever the team needs of you.

Collaboration means setting aside your own pride & insecurities and becoming whatever you need to become for the team to be successful.

Collaboration means team members challenging each other to perform at a higher level than they ever have before and to sustain that high performance over the long-term.

Collaboration means team members caring about each other on a personal level. Team members know about each other's aspirations, the work they enjoy and where they're going with their lives. They care enough to point out specific instances each other performed very well as well as how they can improve.

### Challenge Me!
I've been reading [*Radical Candor*](https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Candor-Kick-Ass-Without-Humanity/dp/1250103509/) by Kim Scott.

The book has really helped me understand that if I truly care about someone, I need to challenge them to keep doing the awesome work they do while also challenging them to improve on areas I know they could do better.

I encourage people who care about me to challenge me! Push me to perform my best and don't take it easy on me to spare my feelings.

I want to be the best I can possibly be and I can't do that without your collaboration!
