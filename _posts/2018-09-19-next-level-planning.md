Life moves forward whether you plan it or not.  Do you know where you're going?

[*The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People*](https://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Powerful/dp/1451639619/) is packed with amazing information.  For reference, the 7 habits are:

1. Be Proactive
2. Begin With The End In Mind
3. Put First Things First
4. Think Win-Win
5. Seek First to Understand, Then To Be Understood
6. Synergize
7. Sharpen the Saw

One of the most impactful takeaways I have put into practice recently is the habit of planning your life.  While planning isn't one of *the* 7 habits, it actually embodies the first 3 habits.

### Be Proactive

The very act of planning out your life is in itself a proactive choice.

The book recommends a weekly planning cadence - plan out your life one week at a time.  You should have longer-term goals and keep them in mind throughout each moment for motivation, but you should plan your progress towards those goals on a weekly basis.

To "Be Proactive" means to use the resources at your disposal to mitigate risks, anticipate problems and create contingency plans for them, and to effectively adjust your plan as new things come up.

### Begin With The End In Mind

In order to effectively plan your week, you need to know where you're going and what you're working towards.

We all have a ton of things we need to get done every week and very often new things come up that require urgent attention throughout the week.  In order to properly prioritize, you need to know what's important to you in life.

What is your mission in life?

What do you want to achieve during your short little burst of life on earth?

[What are your values?](http://sofabshirts.com/define-your-values/)

To "Begin With The End In Mind" means to seriously reflect on where you are going and the values you will hold yourself to in the process of getting there.

### Put First Things First

Have you ever had a crazy busy day, yet as you reflect at the end of the day you realize you didn't really get *anything* done?

Those days are demoralizing, distracting and can make you want to give up on yourself.  You might even rationalize giving up - "See, I just don't have time to improve this area of my life, I need to focus on more immediate concerns."

If you allow yourself to make excuses and give up, you will never be successful because you'll give up every time things get hard.

To "Put First Things First" means to prioritize tasks based on more than just urgency.

The book recommends weighing urgency of tasks - the amount of time before something must be completed - with the importance of tasks - how much impact the task will have on progressing towards your goals.

Then, make a prioritized list of each item for each possible category:

Quartile 1: Important & Urgent

Quartile 2: Important & Not Urgent

Quartile 3: Not Important & Urgent

Quartile 4: Not Important & Not Urgent

The book suggests that most people get bogged down in Quartiles 1 & 3 - the urgent tasks - or they decide to give up on their goals and submit into Quartile 4 - things that aren't important or urgent like watching TV, playing video games or other time-waster activities.

The truly effective people in the world focus on Quartile 2 - things that are important, but not urgent.  For example, taking the time to plan your life is a Quartile 2 activity, along with things like defining your values, building or maintaining relationships with people who are important to you and, in fact, every single habit on the list is a Quartile 2 activity.

Use [this worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qlYBXkTea9AjyFKvUuCIKQF9l_c9kdVWmaKlPmsDTs8/edit?usp=sharing) that I created to use for my own personal planning to map out your activities based on importance and urgency.

List your personal values at the top, add the dates for this week and a value you really want to focus on this week.  Set yourself a weekly goal by asking, "What's the most important thing I can do this week?  Then, start prioritizing your tasks in the columns below.  I also keep a list of helpful reminders or motivational quotes that will inspire me.

Carry this sheet with you at all times and reflect on your goals for the week often.

### Conclusion

If you want to be a highly effective person, planning your life is a great place to start.  You'll get working on 3 of *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People* simultaneously!

Begin by being proactive and making time to reflect on what really matters to you.  Define in detail what you want to do in life and the steps it will take to get there.  Then, based on what you want to do and how you're going to do it, start listing out everything you have to do and prioritizing those things based on their importance and urgency.

Take time every week to reflect on your progress and how you might be able to use your time more effectively.
