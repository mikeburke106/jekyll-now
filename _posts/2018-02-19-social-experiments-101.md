title: Social Experiments 101
---

When people hear that I enjoy doing random social experiments, a lot of people want to know the details.  So, here you go, here are some fun social experiments I like to do on a regular basis to get out of my comfort zone.

### Make Eye Contact

I know what you're thinking - "Oh, I can just make eye contact with people?  How lame, I'm leaving already!"  Good - get out!

Still here?  Cool.

Check out this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EumnijQBhw) to find out how important strong eye contact can be in creating personal connections.  Without saying a word, you can make someone smile, laugh or have an emotional episode, crying or throwing their arms around you in joy.  We suppress our emotions so much in American society, just the simple vulnerability of holding eye contact can break down our emotional barriers.

The experiment is pretty simple - all you have to do is initiate eye contact with everyone you come across as you go about whatever you're doing.  If you successfully make eye contact with someone, hold it as long as you can.  Usually, the other person will break first because sustained eye contact is known as a signal of intimacy or aggression.  If you must break first, whatever you do, don't look down!  Looking down when breaking eye contact is a sign of submission and the entire purpose of this experiment is to practice being assertive and vulnerable.  So, if you must break, break by looking to the side or up.

Occasionally, you will make eye contact with someone who also refuses to break.  Unless they're also doing a social experiment, this usually means they're attracted to you or they've taken your strong eye contact as a sign of aggression.  It should be pretty obvious which is which.  Making eye contact with someone who's attracted to you is a good opportunity to go strike up a conversation with them.  Hey, hey, hey, this experiment just got a whole lot more fun!  Conversely, if someone has taken your actions as a sign of aggression and it looks like they want a fight, it might be time to break eye contact (to the side!) and go find someone less aggressive to experiment on.

Making eye contact with strangers sounds easier than it actually is and once you start doing it regularly, you'll see how bad we are as a society at making the simplest connection with each other.  Let's change that by making eye contact with everyone as often as we can!

### Hold Your Ground (Part 1)

Another experiment I commonly practice is holding my ground as I walk down the sidewalk.  I'm frequently walking the sidewalks of 16th Street Mall in downtown Denver and sometimes those sidewalks can get pretty busy.  A submissive person will be walking down the sidewalk trying to duck and bow out of everyone's way and accidentally bumping into someone sounds like a horrible social faux pas.

What these submissive people fail to understand is that **they have as much right to this public space as anyone else**!  You don't have to duck and bow out of everyone's way - why shouldn't people be ducking and bowing out of your way?  Now, this isn't about being narcissistic or arrogant - "Hey, I'm Big Mike; I'm the shit and everyone can GTFO of my way!" - and I'm certainly not saying that it's somehow wrong to move out of someone's path.  This is an exercise in assertiveness for people who aren't used to being assertive.

Again, the experiment is simple.  Walk down the sidewalk in a straight line with a set path in mind.  Notice when you deviate from that path and for what reason.  As always, self-awareness is the first and most important step. 
 So, at first, just notice how often you change your desired path in order to get out of other people's desired paths.  You'll probably realize you are doing it far more often than you might have guessed.  The next step is to refuse to get out of people's way.  Most people will see your display of assertiveness and fall in line, submitting to you by moving out of your way.  Otherwise, you need to hold your ground all the way to the point of letting them bump into you if necessary.

#### Side Bar
This exercise is about being assertive, **not being aggressive**.  Several people have told me I'm a jerk for practicing this experiment and bumping into people on the sidewalk.  Whether that's true or not is honestly irrelevant to me, but I do feel the need to point out it should feel like an accidental bump and only if the person is truly in your path.  If you're walking around intentionally bumping into people who weren't even in your way, you are a jerk and you're not doing the experiment properly.

Bumping into strangers sounds scary, I know, especially if you're not a very physically intimidating person.  But, it happens all the time every day - it's really not a big deal.  You'll typically get one of three responses.

First, and most likely, you'll get someone who wasn't paying attention to where they were walking and they'll apologize or say, "excuse me," for bumping into you.

Second, you'll get someone who is far too entitled and absolutely offended that you would **DARE** bump into them as they're walking.  Ugh.  These people are the worst.  Make sure to say, "Excuse you!" to these people to make it clear **they bumped you**, not vice versa.

Finally, you'll get the same aggressive, aggro person who also got mad that you made eye contact with them.  They'll start yelling profanity and trying to insult you or provoke you; just keep walking and don't look back.  They'll look dumb yelling at nobody in particular and eventually go about their business.

(I won't give you any flak for not bumping Mr. Aggro-pants, but you also shouldn't be afraid to bump him just because he looks aggressive either.  Many times, someone who looks aggressive will actually either submit to you or fall into one of the first two categories.  Similarly, someone you'd least expect is the one who will start yelling obscenities at you.  This is all about getting out of your comfort zone, so go for it.)

As you start practicing this, you'll notice that if you hold your ground and be confidently assertive, people will actually start submitting to you.  That's a pretty powerful feeling if you've never felt it before.  Do yourself a favor and go feel what assertiveness feels like.

### Hold Your Ground (Part 2)

This one is pretty similar to part 1, but instead of walking around, you're going to be stationary.  Find somewhere with a lot of foot traffic, where it can sometimes be hard to push your way through the crowd (if possible, get there before the crowd does).  Now, you're going to find a good spot where you won't be blocking people's way or anything like that, but you will also be part of the crowd that people are trying to push through.

Found your spot?  Perfect.  Now, I want you to spread your feet a little more than shoulder-width apart and plant.  The experiment, in this case, is to not move for anyone.  If a "bubble" of people starts to form in front of you and the bubble expands such that someone's back is right up in your personal space, you hold your ground.  If people say excuse me or try to "nudge" you out of their way so they can get through, you hold your ground.  If someone keeps stepping on your feet because they're standing so close to you, **YOU HOLD YOUR GROUND**.

Just like Part 1, this isn't about being a jerk or trying to ruin people's day.  If you're intentionally moving to get in people's way or block them from getting through, you're missing the point of the exercise.  The point is that you have as much right to that space as anyone else and you can be assertive in defending the space that you occupy.  You can move to let someone through if you choose, but you are not obligated to.  Be assertive and hold your ground.

Again, just like in Part 1, you'll get the same 4 types of people.  Most people will submit to you and go around.  Some people will apologize, say "excuse me" and try to nudge their way through.  The entitled bunch will be offended that you **DARED** to not move out of their way.  And, of course, Mr. Angry-face will pop up again.  Since you can't walk away from him this time, I suggest ignoring him entirely or acting preoccupied with something happening on the other side of the crowd.  He'll decide you aren't worth his time and he'll move on.

I know, you're still probably scared of the angry guy, but you really shouldn't be.  I've done these experiments hundreds of times, experienced dozens of angry people and they have backed down every single time.  I know I'm a big, sometimes intimidating, man, but I honestly think these people are generally all bark and no bite, just trying to spark terror in people who live their entire lives in fear.  Don't negotiate with these sidewalk terrorists.

Hold your ground.

### Cold Approach

The last experiment I want to share with you has vastly improved my life in nearly every possible way.  I experience less anxiety, I experience less fear, I am more confident in myself and less hesitant to go for things I want in life.  This experiment is called Cold Approach.

Cold approach basically just means walk around and try to start conversations with people you have absolutely no reason to start a conversation with.  If you've ever seen the show *Impractical Jokers*, nearly every one of their "challenges" starts with a cold approach.  Before they can do the prank on someone, they first have to start a conversation with someone.  How likely that person is to play along with the prank depends on how well they opened the conversation with the other person.  These guys are excellent at cold approaching.

Did you and someone else just get stuck at an intersection right before the walk sign turned red?  Try to start a conversation with them about it.  It doesn't have to be a glorious, epic conversation the like the world has never seen before.  It can be as mundane as, "Man, the city should build overpass walking ramps or something!"  All you have to say is **something**.

Most people will look at you weird or give you a polite look to acknowledge your existence.  I mean, let's face it, it's been drilled into us since we were children that talking to strangers is bad and dangerous!  And this dude's walking around intentionally talking to strangers!?  My god, doesn't he know what could happen to him!?

Some people, though.  Some people are alone in a big city where they don't know a single soul.  Maybe they're an extrovert just dying to talk to someone - anyone!  To these people, you are an absolute hero.  And, all you had to do is say something to them.

My brother, Jake, and I cold approached a random girl in Larimer square last summer and it turned out to be one of the most memorable nights in recent memory.  I noticed her looking into the front window of a fancy restaurant and then looking down at her phone, so I walked up and asked if she was waiting for a hot date or something.  We ended up connecting with each other about Pokemon, public speaking, building confidence and several other topics.  It turned out she was visiting with her fiance and she was waiting for him to get out of a work meeting; so, we went and got a drink while we waited for him and I showed them around downtown Denver.

They ended up heading back to California with the impression that Denver is awesome and people in Denver are amazing, helpful and outgoing.  The funniest thing is, I had **no clue** what I was going to say to her when I started walking her direction.  I even started with a mundane, arguably boring, conversation.

As you practice cold approaching people, you'll come up with better ways to start conversations that are more likely to engage the other person from the beginning.  Not only will they want to talk to you, but they will do whatever it takes to make sure you stay with them and keep talking.

The best thing I like about cold approaching - striking up conversations with people you have absolutely no reason to talk to - is that *warm approaching* becomes like a walk in the park.

Want to have a conversation with someone at work you've never met?  Easy as pie!  After all, you have like 100 reasons to talk to that person.  Much better than the 0 reasons you've become accustomed to.

Want to find out something a little more personal about your waiter or Uber driver?  Start by mentioning something about the service and then say, "Hey, by the way, is your belly button an innie or an outie?"  So much easier than the sidewalk!

Want to make a fool out of yourself on stage doing improv?  Well, that's what these people came to see, isn't it?  After being "rejected" on the sidewalk by 100 different strangers, what do you care what these random strangers think of you?

Getting comfortable with cold approaches makes every other social interaction seem ridiculously easy in comparison.

These are my favorite social experiments and I do at least 2 of them practically daily.  Don't like mine?  That's cool, make up your own!  As long as you're being social and doing something that makes you mildly uncomfortable, you're getting out of your comfort zone and you're on the path to self-improvement!
