title: Be a Phoenix
---

A mythological phoenix dies every evening and rises from the ashes every morning.  Happiness can be achieved by making your ego a phoenix.

A fundamental consequence of self-awareness as humans is the ego - how we self-identify in our minds.

We define ourselves by our thoughts and behaviors, whether good or bad.  We judge ourselves in the present based on events from the past.

One might identify as being smart based on their past performance in school, books they've read or accomplishments.  A consequence of self-identifying as being smart is unconsciously identifying others as dumb, which negatively affects our view of the world.

Whoever you were, whatever you did, however you felt in the past is irrelevant to who you are, what you do and how you choose to feel right now.

Don't dwell on the past.  Don't live in an imagined future.  Right now is all that matters.  Choose to be happy in each moment as it comes and, over time, you will be happy in life.

Let your self-identity die and start new every day.  Let your ego be a phoenix.
