title: Value Spirit Animals
---

Associating your values with animals that inspire you can help you remember and embody what's important to you.

Ever since I [defined my values](http://sofabshirts.com/define-your-values/), I recognized that it was fairly difficult to keep those values at the forefront of my mind.  With everything else going on in life, the important things can get drowned out in the information overload our minds are confronted with every day.

When brainstorming ways I could better keep my values in mind on a daily basis, I thought back to an exercise from level 2 improv class.

We started by thinking of an animal and fully embodying that animal.  I thought of a rhinoceros, so I started the exercise on all-fours, moving slowly and giving a deep grunt as a kicked up pretend dirt.  After a couple of minutes, we were instructed to hold on to those animal behaviors, but slowly start to transform into a human.  We spent a couple minutes embodying our animal as a biped, walking around on two legs, but unable to speak.  Then, we became fully human while still fully-embodying our animal.  The human character I became spoke in a low grunting voice, had very dry skin, an irritable temperament and kicked up dirt as an emotional response.  My character was the personification of a rhinoceros.

This was one of my favorite exercises in all of improv class, so I decided to adapt it to solve my ongoing problem.

### Spirit Animals
In order to more closely live by my values, I assigned each value to a spirit animal, trying to find animals that symbolize - at least to me personally - several of my own personal values.

Using these animal definitions, I created phone wallpapers so that I can constantly see my spirit animal and the values they represent throughout my daily life.  As I experience different situations that require me to live by different values, I can practice the lesson from improv by embodying those animals and, specifically, the behaviors or traits that I link to my values.

Here are the wallpapers I came up with:
