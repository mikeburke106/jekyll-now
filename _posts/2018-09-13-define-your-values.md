title: Define Your Values
---

Living your values without having them defined is like following directions where the roads aren't named.

Having well-defined, well-thought-out values can drive your everyday decisions, help you identify time-wasting activities and even affect how you choose to treat people.

If one of your core values is health, you will stop putting off or avoiding doctor appointments, be proactive about any health concerns and live a healthy lifestyle.

If one of your core values is kindness, you will help people who seek you out, build people up at every opportunity and even be kind to yourself instead of beating yourself up for your mistakes.

### Defining Your Values
Make a list of core values that mean the most to you and use those values to make everyday decisions.

Start out with a sheet of paper or a whiteboard and list every value, trait, characteristic, or adjective that is important to you or defines you.  Ask yourself these questions:

> When I'm gone, how do I want my family and friends to describe me?

> What are traits I look for in friends or relationships?

> When I think of my role models, what characteristics do I admire in them?

Keep writing until you've exhausted every word you can think of - give it at least 10 minutes.

Now that you have an exhaustive list of characteristics you value, it's time to start narrowing it down.  Keep reading through the list and start crossing things out.  Look for similar values that could be combined into one, look for values that are important, but not necessarily core to who you are.

Really take some time and thought here.  The more effort you put into this exercise, the more inspiring and useful your final list of values will be.  If you're having trouble narrowing things down, imagine how each value might impact your life and cross out the ones that would have the smallest impact.

Keep going until you have a list you couldn't possibly narrow down further - aim for a list of 5-10.  Prioritize your list by how much each one means to you.

### Live Your Values
Now that you have your list of values, it's time to start living them.  Write each value on a post-it note with a brief description of what it means to you or why it's important and put them up somewhere you will read them every day.

Whenever you have a difficult decision to make, reference your values and you'll find they will guide your decision.  Be mindful of automatic decisions you make every day and decide if that decision fits in your value system.  If it doesn't, consider changing the behavior to more closely live up to your own standards.

When you set goals for the week, prioritize them based on urgency and importance according to your values.  Setting and prioritizing goals is difficult enough on its own, so expect another post about that in the near future.

They say that you are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with.  How do these people measure up to your values?  If someone on your list doesn't measure up, it might be time to make a difficult decision to spend less time with that person.  Spend your time with people who value the same things as you do and you will find synergy with them.  You will propel each other forward and help each other succeed.

Take the effort to define your values, start living mindfully by them and revisit them from time to time.  The impact this simple exercise will have on your life will surprise you.
