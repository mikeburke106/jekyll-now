title: A Great Leader Does the Hard Things
---

A great leader does whatever needs to be done, especially when it's difficult.

One of my brothers and I were having a discussion about leadership after mentioning he's been reading Simon Sinek's book, *[Leaders Eat Last: Why Some Teams Pull Together and Others Don't](https://www.amazon.com/Leaders-Eat-Last-Together-Others/dp/1591848016/)*.

He shared a story with me about how he applied the knowledge from the book in his leadership role.

### A Great Leader Makes Bold Moves

My brother explained a time where morale was low on his team; nobody was excited for what they were doing and everyone would have rather been practically anywhere else. He made a bold move and decided to give everyone on his team an hour-long break during an important shift. 

Such a long break during working hours was not normal and was not approved by his superiors, but he could tell his people needed it, so he did what had to be done.

### A Great Leader Accepts Responsibility

Someone on the team expressed concern - "What if someone catches us not working, won't we get in trouble?"  My brother told his team not to worry about it, that he - as their leader - would take the heat for the decision.

Even if it meant losing his position, my brother was willing to take the risk because the outcome of having amazingly motivated workers was worth the risk of losing his own job.

After the break, the entire team came back energized, excited and ready to work harder than they had worked all day.  Despite the lost hour, they still completed all of their work and had gained a newfound respect, trust, and admiration for their leader, who was willing to risk so much for their well-being.

### A Great Leader Lives With Integrity

After earning a deeper trust with his team, I'm sure my brother could have asked the team to keep it quiet so his superiors didn't find out about it.  Instead, immediately after his shift, he proactively sought out his supervisor and explained the situation.

He owned up to his decision and ensured the news came directly from him, not through the grapevine.  He could have been fired, demoted or reprimanded for his actions, but he owned up to his decision with complete transparency anyway.

Living with integrity means being who you are and doing what you do no matter who is watching you.  When you're alone, you are the same person you are when you're surrounded by hundreds or thousands of people. You make a decision and you stand by it no matter what.

### A Great Leader Eats Last

A great leader makes extreme personal sacrifices for the benefit of those they lead. If there isn't enough food for everyone to eat, the leader is the one who goes without while everyone else eats in abundance.

This simple sacrifice shows the entire team who is most important to their leader - they are.

Leadership is never easy - on the contrary. Leadership requires doing the hard thing every time. It means taking all the blame for things that go wrong and delegating praise for things that go right. Leadership means falling on your sword over and over again so the people who follow can walk away with pride.

I'm proud of my brother and his leadership skills at such a young age. He and I will continue to eat last.
