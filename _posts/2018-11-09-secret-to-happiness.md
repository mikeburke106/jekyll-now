title: The Secret to Happiness

No matter your circumstances, you can achieve happiness and it's easier than you think.

### Anxiety & Depression

I struggled for many years with anxiety and depression. I would spend days without leaving home, sometimes without even getting out of bed. I remember a time when I moved my living room furniture around and dragged my mattress into the living room just so I could watch TV and play video games while laying in bed.

I remember having two TVs set up around my couch - one hooked up to cable, one hooked up to the Xbox 360. I would watch TV, play Madden & usually have my 3DS open playing Pokemon simultaneously - I needed that much sensory input just to escape my negative thoughts.

After wasting yet another day, I beat myself up with more depressing thoughts. Not knowing if tomorrow would be any better, I would get anxious about the future. It's a vicious cycle that's extremely hard to break.

Depression is what happens when you're living in the past. Anxiety is what happens when you're living in the future.

### The Secret

The secret to happiness: **living in the present**.

Living in the present means not thinking about the past or future and putting 100% focus into right now. Whatever you're doing right now, do it with intent and mindfulness. You can do anything with 100% focus. Even if you're just doing the dishes - feel the soapy water on your hands, hear the splash of the water, feel the various textures of the dishes, smell the scent of the soap, notice your muscles contracting and relaxing as you move your arms, notice your feelings.

Especially in today's world of instant gratification with smartphones, Facebook, infinite entertainment at your fingertips at all times, focusing this intensely can be extremely difficult and requires practice. A great way to practice focusing your mind is through meditation. If you can put 100% focus into something as simple as breathing without allowing your mind to take control, you can put 100% focus into anything. I meditate at least 10 minutes every day and I highly recommend you give it a try. There's an app called [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) that can help you get started.

When you have complete control over your emotions in the present moment, you can choose to be happy no matter what your circumstances are. If you choose to be happy in each and every moment, the moments will add up to a happy life.

I'll definitely be writing more content about presence, happiness, and meditation in the future. In the meantime, I recommend checking out [The Power of Now](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Now-Guide-Spiritual-Enlightenment/dp/1577314808/) by Eckhart Tolle.
