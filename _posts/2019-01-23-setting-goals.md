title: Setting Goals

Your actions will lead to random outcomes unless your goals are clear.

### Why Goals Matter

How do you climb a mountain? One step at a time.

Some paths up a mountain are much more challenging than others; if you wander towards the peak without a solid path to the top, you're likely to put in a lot of effort without making much progress. Your journey to the peak is much easier if you take the time to map out your path.

The ideal "you" is your personal mountain to climb and the goals you set for yourself define the path to get there. If your map is weak, you won't make it very far no matter how much energy you put in and no matter how much action you take. 

Without a clear path, you are wandering aimlessly. You will feel like you're always working, but never making progress. You will give up in frustration and settle for mediocrity.

### Define the Destination

Before you can create a map, you must know where you're going. What does the ideal "you" look like? How do they behave towards themselves and others? What really matters to them in the world? What is their mission in life and what are they doing to make it happen?

This is no easy task. It takes hours of reflection, journaling, and self-assessment to find out what really matters to you in life. You must reflect on your childhood and re-discover your inner passions and fascinations before social conditioning hammered your sense of identity out of you. You must reflect on your inevitable death and consider what legacy you want to leave with those who knew you.

These are complex questions with answers you can't just look up on Google. It takes time and careful consideration to define what you want to be. You'll get out what you put into this exercise, so I highly recommend at least 10 hours of focused effort into defining your ideal self and re-assess about once a year.

The clearer your vision of the future, the more effectively you'll be able to map out the path to get there. Express this vision as a list of lifetime goals.

### Mapping the Path

Once you know where you're going, you can start mapping your path to get there. Your list of lifetime goals is your starting point.

For each lifetime goal, define several (at least three) milestones you need to reach to achieve the ultimate goal. In systematic fashion, define milestones to achieve each of those milestones and continue until you can see a clear path to the ultimate goal.

For example, if one of my lifetime goals is to be the President of the United States, what milestones might I need to achieve to get there?

1. Foster a positive public image
1. Get elected to Congress
1. Establish myself as an effective leader

Now, break down each of those milestones. How might I foster a positive public image?

1. Express body language, poise, and character of a strong leader
1. Plan photo opportunities at important events
1. Take ownership of bad situations and take action to improve them

How might I get elected to Congress?

1. Earn a degree in political science
1. Run an effective campaign for a position in local government
1. Gain experience and exceed expectations in local position

Like I said earlier, there are multiple paths to the top. Your map might look much different than mine to achieve the same result. That's fine. Don't worry about making your map perfect, just worry about making it clear. As you explore the terrain, you can make adjustments to improve the accuracy of your path.

### Synergy
As you gain more and more clarity on your map, certain areas of synergy will begin to emerge. In the example above, learning to effectively market yourself is going to help achieve early milestones and will also be useful in achieving later milestones.

Identify these areas of synergy and focus your energy on mastering related skills. Do a realistic self-assessment of where you are now and formulate a plan to gain the experiences you need to achieve the next milestone.

### Walk the Path
As you continue this process of working backward, you will eventually be able to see that very next step you can take right now. Once you take that step, the following step will become clear.

You need to be flexible - maybe the terrain isn't quite what it was when you set out on your adventure. Review your goals regularly to make sure your destination is still relevant to you and to ensure your milestones are still accurately leading to that destination.

With your map complete, all you need to do is walk down the path.
