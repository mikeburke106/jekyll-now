title: Let Yourself Be Wrong
---

Connect with other people by letting yourself be wrong.

I was talking with a friend the other day about a parody of a movie cover we saw.  We both thought it was great, but my friend pointed out that someone in the parody was facing the opposite direction than in the real movie cover.

I knew they were wrong, so I said, "No, I think it's right."  They persisted, "No, I *know* it's wrong - I just looked at them side-by-side earlier."

The "old me" wanted to bring up both pictures side-by-side right then and there in order to **prove** who was actually right.  I knew I was right and I wanted the satisfaction of someone acknowledging it.

The "new me" paused and asked myself:

> What good would it do to point out to someone that they were wrong about some inconsequential detail?  How would that help me?  How would that help them?

In the larger picture, does it really matter if that person was facing the right way or not?  Is that detail going to have any minuscule impact on my life or the world?  No way!

### Why do we want so badly to be right?

Simple - EGO.

I wanted an ego boost.  If I ever feel stupid or wrong in the future, I can point back to this and remind myself how right I was and someone else was wrong.  Surely, I can't be stupid if I was right and someone else was wrong... right?  I've already expressed in a couple posts how I feel about ego: ["Screw Your Ego, Live Your Values"](http://sofabshirts.com/screw-your-ego/), [Be a Phoenix](http://sofabshirts.com/be-a-phoenix/).  This is just another reason to let your ego die.

When you prove someone wrong about some inconsequential fact, all you're doing is making them feel bad, stupid, or wrong themselves.  You're making them feel that feeling you're trying to avoid!  Since your behavior is what caused this negative feeling, you have created a negative association in your friend's brain to associate your presence to negative feelings.

Is an inconsequential ego boost really worth alienating a friendship over something that was irrelevant from the beginning?

Instead, I simply said, "Oh okay, I'm sure you're right" and moved the conversation forward.  I still knew with absolute certainty I was right, but I let go of the need to prove it.

Let yourself be wrong.
