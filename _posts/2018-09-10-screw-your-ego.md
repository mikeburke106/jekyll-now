title: Screw Your Ego, Live Your Values
---

If you're like most people, your ego is controlling your life.

Think of a time recently where you felt an impulse to do something, but decided not to.  Why didn't you do it?  Were you afraid to look stupid or otherwise be socially judged?  If so, you likely unconsciously let your ego make the decision for you instead of you making the decision for yourself.

It doesn't matter what the impulse was and it doesn't even *really* matter you didn't take action on it, specifically.  The **habit of inaction** and the **ramifications of that habitual inaction** are what matters.

### Habitual Inaction
When you habitually refuse to take action, you have given up control of your life to your ego.

Why does judgment from others mean so much to us?  Our minds see these judgments as social proof and use this social proof as evidence of an objective truth.

For example, if you're walking down the sidewalk and see 15 people staring straight up, your mind sees many people communicating the same message - "there's something up there" - and interprets the communal message as objective truth - "there must be something up there if so many people are looking up there".  The vast majority of people will join the group by looking up, at least for a moment.  We are socially conditioned to believe whatever the group believes.

Allowing these social signals to control our behavior causes us to behave in a manner that may conflict with our inner values.  We project our own social biases onto others - "I think that's stupid, so if I do that, other people will think I'm stupid".

Make decisions based on your own inner values, not social pressure.

### Ramifications of Habitual Inaction
When you habitually fail to take action, you create a "downward spiral" in your life.  You are literally conditioning your brain to continue to refuse to take action.  The more you train your brain for inaction, the easier inaction becomes and the harder any action becomes.  This spirals out of control until your brain decides the habit is so strong, it needs to be controlled by the unconscious.  Next thing you know, you never take action and you don't even think about it or consider it a problem.

Now, you will never take action, you will never control your life and you aren't even consciously aware of how you're sabotaging yourself.  It's just about the worst situation you can be in.

So, how do you break the cycle?  Just work backward:

- Pay attention and become self-aware of your emotions and desires
- Notice when you have a desire and fail to take action on it
- Notice when you have a desire and force yourself to take action on it
- Continue to force yourself to take action until it becomes habitual

Repeat this process to create an "upward spiral".  You begin taking action unconsciously, you begin addressing your problems immediately, and you begin taking control of your life.

Screw your ego, live by your values.
