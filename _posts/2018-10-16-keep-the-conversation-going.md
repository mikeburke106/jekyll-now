Use these strategies to avoid the dreaded awkward silence.

We've all been in a situation where we're talking to someone we don't know very well - a stranger,  a mutual friend, or a first date - and eventually the conversation fizzles out into an awkward silence.

Here are a couple strategies to avoid this awkward social situation.

### Presence
One of the worst habits people have as communicators is not being present as they listen. You might be thinking ahead to what to say next or how the topic of conversation applies to you.

Instead, focus on being fully present and truly listening to the other person. Make good eye contact, listen to the words and, most importantly, seek to understand the thoughts and emotions those words are trying to express by paying attention to nonverbal communication.

It's impossible for our words to fully communicate our thoughts and emotions, so pay attention to the small details and try to understand what they're really trying to communicate with you.

### Prefer Assumptions Over Questions
When first meeting someone, many people have a bad habit of asking too many questions before building rapport and trust.

Asking questions puts all the pressure on the other person to make the conversation interesting and makes them feel like they're being interrogated. Nobody wants to be interrogated or share personal information with a stranger, so they will want to end the conversation as quickly as possible.

For example, one of the most common (and detrimental) conversations we've all heard a thousand times might go something like this:

> Hi, I'm Mike.  What's your name?

> Jim.

> Nice to meet you, Jim.  What do you do for a living?

> I'm a barista.

> That's cool, where do you barista?

> Starbucks.

> Nice, which Starbucks?

> The one down on 8th Ave.

> Hmm, I've never been to that one before.  Do you like it there?

> Yeah, it's alright.

> ... <awkward silence ensues>

> Cool, so where do you live?... How long have you been there?... Do you like it there?...


Instead of asking questions, make assumptions.  Your assumptions can be random or they can be cold reads - notice something about them and take a guess.

For example, if I meet someone and notice they have longer fingernails on one hand than the other, I might make a cold read:

>I can tell you're a musician - I'm guessing classical guitar?

If I don't notice anything in particular about them, I might just make a random assumption like:

> Always good to meet another midwesterner!

or

> I can tell you're an only child, I bet that was interesting growing up.

The beauty of assumptions is that they work whether you're right or not.

If you're right, the other person will be blown away by how intuitive and attentive you are - it's as if they already know you and you've built instant comfort with them.

If you're wrong, they will be intrigued and will wonder what made you think that about them.  You automatically have something interesting to talk about that is different from the everyday boring conversations they're used to and directly related to the relationship between the two of you.

If you must ask questions, make them open-ended and related to the other person's passions and personality instead of fact-based answers. For example, if someone tells you they work at Starbucks, instead of asking which one or how long they've been there, ask them what's their favorite thing about working there, how they got into that line of work or transition to a conversation about their dream job. The conversation should be about the two of you, not random facts.

### Word Association
You should usually respond directly to what the other person just said, but if you ever reach a point where you can't think of anything, use word association to bail yourself out.

Word association is simple - just say the first word that comes into your mind and force yourself to keep talking.  It really doesn't matter what it's about as long as you get something out before that awkward silence kicks in.

Depending on the specific situation, changing the subject to something random and unrelated to what the other person was talking about may make them feel like you aren't listening to them or you don't care about what they were talking about, so use this approach sparingly.  Changing the subject to something random will at least keep the conversation moving and avoid the awkward silence.
