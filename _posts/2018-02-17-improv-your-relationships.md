title: Improv(e) Your Relationships
---

Stories are all about relationships.

*Romeo and Juliet* is about their relationship it affects the other relationships in their lives.

*The Lion King* is about Simba's relationship with his father, uncle, friends, and society.

*Toy Story* is about each individual toy's relationship with Andy and their relationships with each other.

People connect with these stories because of the strong emotional bonds between the various characters.

> Your life is an improvised story

Great improvisers know how to build personal relationships effectively.  No matter what the scene is about, the audience won't connect with the material until a meaningful relationship is established between the characters.

As with many improvisation skills, the ability to connect with others and build relationships is a skill that can be translated directly into our daily lives.

### Listen Without Judgement

A great relationship requires great communication and great communication starts with great listening.

The average person sucks at listening.  They hear your words, but they don't hear what you're trying to communicate with them.  Typically, they're thinking of what they're going to say next, how they want to control the conversation or they're distracted by something else happening in their mind.

Listening requires more than your ears, it requires all of your senses.  Does a skunk need to speak words to let you know it wants you to go away?

Rarely in life do people express their explicit thoughts and feelings; in fact, the human brain is poorly designed to do so.  A great relationship doesn't depend on words, it depends on reading between the lines to find the intended meaning of those words through non-verbal communication.

When people share something with you, it's important to be non-judgmental.  If you show any sign of judgment, you've already broken their trust.  It can be helpful to first simply control your judgmental reaction, but you ultimately want to let go of judgment entirely.

### Share Your Vulnerabilities

Sharing our vulnerabilities is a sign of trust and can help build connections with others.

Superman was a practically invulnerable superhero with infinite powers until kryptonite was introduced to the DC comic universe.  Being invulnerable made Superman horribly unrelatable to his audience of mere mortals.  After all, he couldn't possibly conceive of fear, doubt, anxiety, or many other basic human emotions.

If you don't share your vulnerabilities, you will be as utterly unrelatable and uninteresting as Superman.  You aren't some invulnerable super-human, perfect in every way.  So, share your personal kryptonite with the people you care about.

### Give and Take

A great relationship requires giving and taking in many different contexts.  For example, when communicating, both parties must take time to be quiet and simply listen (give) and both parties must express themselves (take).  A relationship where one party either never shuts up or never speaks up is unlikely to be a strong, healthy relationship.

Consider the following dialogue:

> "Oh my god, this fruit punch is absolutely disgusting!"
> "Actually, I made the punch.  It's a family recipe that's been in my family for generations.  My grandmother helped me make this batch just this morning."

The first line is an obvious "give" - the first character is giving the scene an intended topic of conversation.  The second line is an obvious "take" - the second character interprets the first line to mean "our scene is about how this fruit punch affects our relationship" and establishes an emotional connection based on that.

Just as every line in an improv scene is a gift, every sentence in a social interaction is a gift.  In order to build a great relationship, you have to take that gift and turn it into an emotional connection.  If you move on to an unrelated topic, you have rejected their gift.  You're either not listening or you don't care about what the other person said; both are fast-tracks to spoiled relationships.

### Yes, And

A great relationship is supportive and collaborative.  A great relationship partner encourages you to follow your dreams - no matter how improbable they seem - and encourages you to become better than you thought possible.

There are three types of people in the world: "No" people, "Yes, But" people and "Yes, And" people.

"No" people are toxic.  They will shoot down any idea you ever have and will discourage you at every turn.  They will make you believe your dreams and desires are unlikely, impractical, and even impossible.  They will actively prevent you from succeeding in your endeavors.  Remove these toxic people from your life at all costs.

"Yes, But" people are basically "No" people in disguise.  They will express excitement for your ideas and then proceed to tell you every reason your ideas won't work.  They appear to be supportive since they said "yes" to your idea, but they will never help you succeed.  They are nearly as bad as "No" people.

"Yes, And" people will not only support your dreams and desires, they will actively help you make them happen, no matter how impossible it sounds.  Surrounding yourself with "Yes, And" people will exponentially improve your chances of success in life.

Which type of person are you?

If you aren't a "Yes, And" person, you should consider doing some self-reflection and start transforming yourself into one.

"Yes, And" is the most fundamental concept in improv.  Accordingly, practicing improv has introduced me to a wide variety of "Yes, And" people.  I am grateful for each and every one of them.

### Conclusion

Great improv and a great life require emotional connections and strong relationships.  Build relationships by listening, being vulnerable, giving and taking, and being a "Yes, And" person.
