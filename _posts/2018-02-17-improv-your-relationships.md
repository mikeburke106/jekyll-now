Stories are all about relationships.

*Romeo and Juliet* is not about love; it is about the relationship between Romeo and Juliet and how that relationship affects the other relationships in their lives.

*The Lion King* is not about life on the Serengeti, it is about Simba's relationship with his father, uncle, friends, and society.

*Toy Story* is not about a bunch of unrelated talking toys, it is about each individual toy's relationship with Andy and the toys relationships with each other.

People connect with these stories because of the strong emotional bonds between the various characters.

> Life is improvised

Improv comedy is one of the best ways to learn to build personal relationships.  An improv scene usually starts with something mundane, boring or trivial.  Two people are sitting at a table drinking from their cups.  Someone is playing making scrambled eggs, or maybe browsing the grocery store aisle.

Is this why people go to see improv shows?  Obviously not - a scene has no significance to the audience until a meaningful relationship is established.  So, as an improv actor, one of your main goals is to establish a relationship with the other actors on stage.

The process of building relationships on stage is the same as building relationships in life.  In improv, you might be starting in the middle of an established relationship an discover the details of that relationship during the scene.  In reality, however, we typically have to start from scratch at the beginning.

### Listen Without Judgement

The first absolutely key aspect of building relationships is to listen.  I don't mean to just hear the words someone is speaking while you continue reading the news or browsing social media.  I mean **put the damn phone down, clear your mind and pay attention**.  The words we use are only a small part of communication - you also need to pay attention to non-verbals.  You need to read body language, notice microexpressions in the context of the current topic of conversation and even listen for small changes in vocal tonality.

You must learn to read between the lines instead of taking mere words at face value.  Imagine seeing a close family member desperately crying into their hands.  You ask what's wrong and they respond, "Nothing's wrong, I'm fine!".  You would be a fool to take those words at face value; after all, nobody sobs into their hands when everything in life is going fine.  That might sound obvious, but rarely in life do people actually spell out their exact thoughts and feelings.   To build a personal relationship, you have to read between the lines.

Honest communication is absolutely key in building personal relationships.  If you want people to share their honest thoughts and feelings with you, you need to be non-judgemental of those thoughts and feelings.  If someone shares with you something they're ashamed of and you respond with even the slightest impression of disgust or surprise, that person is unlikely to take such a risk again for fear of being judged as a bad person.  Practice controlling your emotions and withholding judgement, you'd be surprised how effectively this will build trust.

### Share Your Vulnerabilities

Before kryptonite was introduced into the DC comic universe, Superman was a practically invulnerable hero with infinite powers.  Contrary to what you might think, the concept of being invulerable did not make readers or fans more fascinated with him, but it actually made him completely and utterly unrelatable to us mere mortals.  After all, how could an invulnerable superhero even pretend to contemplate common human emotions like fear, doubt or anxiety?  If you don't share your vulnerabilities with those around you, you will be just as unrelatable as the invulerable Superman, without the benefits of super powers.

Sharing your vulnerabilities with friends is a great way to connect with them.  You had a first date last night and you were so nervous, you spilled your drink all over yourself while you tried to take a drink?  It might be embarassing in the moment, but other's will connect with those feelings of anxiety and embarassment.  You're not some invulnerable super-human, perfect in every way; you're just another human being with the same imperfections as everyone else.  That is a very powerful premise.

### Give and Take

When you're interacting with people in a social situation, you want to find a good balance of "Give and Take".  In an improv scene, "take" means to take the focus of a scene away from another character, or maybe to take a gift that someone else has given.  "Give" means to draw the focus of a scene away from yourself to someone else, or to say something that gives a gift for someone else to take that will make the scene more appealing to the audience.

For example, if, during a scene, I said something like, "Oh my god, this fruit punch is absolutely disgusting," I am giving my scene partners the gift of some topic of conversation for the scene; they need to take that gift and use it to escalate the emotional impact of the scene.  Someone might respond, "Actually, I made the punch; it's a family recipe that's been passed down for centuries.  My grandma helped me make this batch just this morning."  Two simple lines of dialog and already, the scene is interesting and emotionally engaging.  We have some conflict, we have emotional connection between a character and her grandmother, and, most of all, we have suspense.  What's going to happen next!?  Is the first person going to apologize or say he was joking or something?  Is he going to stand his ground and say her family needs to update their recipe now that sugar is a household ingredient?  How will she respond to whatever he chooses to say next?  The audience is hooked.

In terms of social interactions, this means you need to give gifts of conversation topics and take the gifts that are offered to you.  When someone tells you they went to college for journalism in Massachusetts and subsequently moved to Los Angeles to be a field reporter, they have just offered you many gifts.  You can accept one of those gifts by moving the conversation to one of the topics they just mentioned - college, journalism, Massachusetts, LA or field reporting.  If you move on to a different, unrelated topic, you have chosen not to accept their gift, which makes it look like you're not listening or you're not interested in what the other person has to say.

### Yes, And

No, this doesn't mean you have to be a "Yes Man," or a pushover in any way, shape or form.  All this means is to accept the current reality and do something to solidify the current reality.  If a scene partner walks out on stage holding out their hand and says, "Someone here order a birthday cake?" and you respond, "That's not a birthday cake, it's a birthday snake!" you might get a laugh, but you have just utterly ruined the scene by refusing to accept the reality of the situation.  You have now forced your scene mate to do one of two things: reject their original reality in order to accept your new reality or reject your new reality and try to force their reality.  This is jarring for the audience and creates a sense of uncomfort for the actors and the audience alike.

In social situations, this means to live in the moment, in reality, but also have some fun in the process.  If you're feeling anxious about being at a social gathering, don't try to reject that reality by pretending to be comfortable or acting like you're not anxious - accept the anxiety and use it to your advantage.  Start a conversation with someone about how you don't really know anybody and you're feeling a little anxious - you're likely not the only one feeling those emotions, so connect with someone about them.

Similarly, if someone says your necklace looks like an alien artifact, have some fun with it.  Instead of saying, "No, it's actually the emblem from Skyward Sword," and potentially killing the conversation, "Yes, And" their comment.  Improvise a story about how you came to find the alien artifact when you saw an object fall from the sky in your backyard and decided it must be good luck, so you wear it as a necklace.  Take yourself a little less seriously and have some fun with people you interact with.  People love breaking out of the normal everyday mundane conversations, so give them that gift with a unique story.

The lessons you'll learn when practicing improv comedy will help you connect with other people, take yourself less seriously and build strong, lasting relationships with people you maybe just met.  Take these lessons and use them to your advantage.
