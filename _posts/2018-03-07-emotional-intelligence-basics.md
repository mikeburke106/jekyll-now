One of my most popular and requested tech talks is called [Emotional Intelligence At Work](/files/Emotional-Intelligence-At-Work.pdf).  Emotional and social skills are more than 4x more important than IQ when it comes to professional success.  So, let's talk about the very basics of emotional intelligence and how you can apply these principles in your daily life.

## What is Emotional Intelligence?

Definitions vary widely, but emotional intelligence (EI) is basically the degree to which you understand and can control your emotions and the emotions of those around you.  Unlike IQ, EI can be taught, learned and improved with practice.  Emotional intelligence is a skill that can be developed.

### 1. Self-Awareness

> Once we know ourselves, we may learn how to care for ourselves.
>
> *Socrates*

If you learn anything from reading this, I want you to understand this concept.  Self-awareness is a fundamental condition that makes being human so great.  Without self-awareness, we would be nothing more than the plants in the ground or the water filling the oceans - we would simply exist and that would be all our so-called lives had to offer.

Luckily, we are self-aware and, even more luckily, self-awareness can be honed and improved with dedication and practice.

So, what exactly do I mean by self-awareness?  In an EI context, self-awareness means being aware of your current emotional state throughout your daily life and making time to reflect and introspect on those emotional states.

You may believe you're already aware of your emotional state, but are you really?  When you're in an irritable mood, do you recognize it before you act on it?  Or is it the action that made you aware of the emotion?  Think of the last time you "lost control" of your emotions - maybe it was yelling at someone, maybe it was breaking down crying, or maybe it was laying in bed all day with no desire to get up.  If you became aware of the underlying emotions sooner, you could have processed those emotions in your cerebral cortex (the logical part of the brain) before you made an impulsive action.

How do we practice self-awareness and enhance this skill?

#### Mindfulness Meditation

There are many types of meditation; mindfulness meditation is a type of meditation where you focus on breathing, but you will inevitably be distracted by your brain.  When a distraction happens, recognize, without judgement, what thoughts are distracting you from your goal.  These same thoughts are probably distracting you and affecting your emotions throughout your daily life.

As you continue to practice mindful meditation, you will start noticing your thoughts more regularly and more quickly.  This gives you more time to send those thoughts through your cerebral cortex and make a logical decision in regards to whether those thoughts are helping you or hindering you and take appropriate action.

You should not only understand your emotions, but the reason behind them as well.  Once you understand what you're feeling, try to understand why you're feeling that way.  If you notice you're angry - why are you angry?  If you can control whatever it is that makes you angry, you should do what you can to take it out of your life.  If you can't control the environment, your only choice is to control the emotional reaction to it.

### 2. Self-Control

> No man is free who cannot command himself.
>
> *Pythagoras*

I want you to think back to the last time you felt like you had no self-control and did something you wish you would have done differently.  How long did it take you to notice the err of your ways?  If you aren't practicing self-awareness, you're unlikely to even notice what you're doing.  Maybe you went for some ice cream and ended up eating the whole pint.  Maybe you flipped someone off in traffic.  Whatever it was, you could have improved the situation with some self-awareness; after all, how are you supposed to stop doing something if you don't even notice you're doing it?

Self-control is more than about resisting temptations and sticking to goals.  Self-control also means controlling your body in the way you stand, move and otherwise present yourself.  It means forcing yourself to stand up straight, keep your hands out of your pockets, chin up and make eye contact with people.  Whether your self-esteem or confidence is low or off the charts, simply controlling your body in that same way will make you seem confident and appealing to other people.

Once you start practicing self-awareness and self-control, you have will soon unlock one of the greatest secrets that humanity will ever discover...

#### The Key to Happiness

Since I was a teenager, I struggled with depression and anxiety.  I would have panic attacks before dates, job interviews or other stressful situations; I would sit at home doing nothing but sleep, watch TV and play video games for days at a time.  I wasn't even aware of the fact that my emotions were totally under my own control the entire time.

Once I started doing mindfulness meditation, I started noticing these feelings sooner and sooner after I started feeling them.  I was able to take action based on a logical decision instead of an emotional decision.  I was able to **control my emotions** instead of **my emotions controlling me**.

Everyone knows that your emotions can cause your body to behave in ways specific to that particular emotion.  When you're in despair at the loss of a loved one, you feel weak in the knees, you might even fall to the ground; your eyes start watering and your face clenches into a frown.  When you're excited to be out on a date with that person you find very attractive, your feed might start bouncing, you might feel ecstatic and your face will be full of energy and joy.

What not everyone knows, however, is the body-mind relationship goes both ways.  So, not only can your emotions control your body, but your body can also control your emotions.  Without thinking of anything particularly sad, hold your face in a large frown, drop your head into your hands and move into a kind of fetal position.  Without thinking of anything sad, you will begin to feel sad regardless.

I used this fact to my advantage to permanently get over my depression and anxiety.

Whenever I notice myself feeling sad for no apparent reason, I force my body into a position the exudes happiness and joy.  I use self-awareness skills to determine the feeling of sadness and identify it as an unjustified emotion.  Then, I force my body to do something that I would do when I'm extremely happy.  Maybe I'll throw my hands in the air and jump up and down in joy; I'll think of some hilarious time in my life that I can't help but laugh.

Keep doing this every time you notice negative emotions and before you know it, you will notice yourself experiencing less negative emotions.  You might even start feeling what true happiness feels like and it will be completely under your control.

### 3. Social Awareness

Once you have perfected being aware of and controlling your own emotions, it's time to take those skills you've developed and turn them towards the outside world.



### 4. Social Influence
