### Why Devious?

For as long as I can remember, I was always taught to obey the rules.  Brush your teeth.  Clean your room.  Be quiet and attentive in class.  The act of disobedience in youth is usually accompanied by a harsh punishment and negative renforcement.  You're grounded.  Leave the room in humiliation and go to the Principal's office.  You must stay after school for detention.  Fall in line and obey or something bad will happen to you.

Is it any wonder there are so few leaders when we are trained from childhood to be followers?

#### Do The Right Thing

True leaders don't just blindly obey; they do what they feel is right, no matter what.  If you do what you feel is right, you are likely to have better results than you would have by doing the wrong thing.

#### Face the Consequences

Disobedience can still definitely be accompanied by harsh punishment, but, a leader will do what they feel is right in the face of that harsh punishment.  A leader is willing to gladly accept that punishment because failing to stand up for what he or she feels is right is a far greater punishment.

#### Vision

My goal is to spread the rebellious spirit; to start a revolution of unique and amazing people who will make the decision to think for themselves, go their own way and do what they think is right.
