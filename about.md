# Why Devious?

For as long as I can remember, I was always taught to obey the rules.  Brush your teeth.  Clean your room.  Be quiet and attentive in class.  The act of disobedience in youth is usually accompanied by a harsh punishment and negative renforcement.  You're grounded.  Leave the room in humiliation and go to the Principal's office.  You must stay after school for detention.  Fall in line and obey or something bad will happen to you.

Is it any wonder there are so few leaders when we are trained from childhood to be followers?

## Do The Right Thing

True leaders don't just blindly obey; they do what they feel is right, no matter what.  If you do what you feel is right, you are likely to have better results than you would have by doing the wrong thing.

As an example, let's talk about the bane of a software developer's existence: reoccurring meetings.

When you're invited to a required meeting, there are a few rules you're expected to adhere to:

  - Attendance - you must show up at the meeting on time and stay until the end time or until you are explicitly dismissed
  - Attention - you must sit quietly until called upon and listen attentively to the person speaking
  - Action (Items) - you must take a list of action items to follow up on during the next meeting

Anyone who's been in even a semi-corporate environment knows that most meetings are a waste of time.  People walk in late because meetings are booked back-to-back and often go too long.  Too many people are included on the meeting, so most people aren't engaged and might even be browsing their phones or laptops.  When someone new is called on, they need to be brought up on the current topic of conversation because they weren't paying attention.

These types of meetings are nothing but a **waste of time**!  Do we really need 20 people in a 2 hour meeting?  You might be saying yes, but do we REALLY need all 20 people?  If Bill has a family emergency and has to leave early, is the meeting really going to drastically suffer?  It's possible, but likely not.  Couldn't the host facilitate communication between the relevant parties without having every possible participant stuffed in a single physical location for the entire duration of the meeting?

If meetings are a waste of time, you should disobey the expectation and don't go to them.  Attend meetings that are goal-oriented, purposeful and productive.  Skip meetings that are not productive.  If you absolutely must attend, insist on answering anything required for you when the meeting starts and then dismiss yourself.

Use the time you save from skipping unproductive meetings productively.  Create well-written and up-to-date documentation so when people have common questions, you can direct them to the explanation instead of explaining it repeatedly.  Automate everything you possibly can to save time in the long run.  

## Face the Consequences

Disobedience can still definitely be accompanied by harsh punishment, but, a leader will do what they feel is right in the face of that harsh punishment.  A leader is willing to gladly accept that punishment because failing to stand up for what he or she feels is right is a far greater punishment.

# Vision

My goal is to spread the rebellious spirit; to start a revolution of unique and amazing people who will make the decision to think for themselves, go their own way and do what they think is right.
