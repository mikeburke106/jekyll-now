### Social Fabric

"Social fabric" is a term that represents the implied contractual agreement for how members of society will treat each other.  In some societies, it might be common practice to start yelling at a complete stranger on the sidewalk.  In other societies, it might be frowned upon to even attempt to make eye contact with a stranger.

Once an agreement has been established, can it ever be changed?  Or, are all members of the society doomed to survive under the current agreement?  What if that agreement could be improved over time and adaptable to change within the society?  At Social Fabric, we believe not only the social fabric of a society can and should be improved, but also that it is the civic duty of members of that society to drive those improvements.

Martin Luthor King, Jr. drove change that fueled a revolution to improve civil rights for minorities in America.  Gandhi led a movement for freedom and equality that eventually led to India's independence from British rule.  I would venture to guess that if you asked either man about themselves, they wouldn't claim to be heroes; they would simply claim they stood up to accept their civic duty.

#### Better Yourself, Better the World

Change starts with you.  You have to live and breathe the change that you want to see in the world.  Do you want people to be more kind, charitable and fun?  When was the last time you did something truly kind like genuinely compliment a stranger?  When was the last time you were truly charitable - did you go out and help someone or just write a check?  When was the last time you did something truly fun like start a spontaneous game of tag with strangers in a busy park?  If you start living your dream before society has accepted it, people will be looking at you and might even judge you and your behavior.  You will be polarizing - some people will love you and some people will hate you just as some people loved and hated Martin Luthor King, Jr., Gandhi, and all the other changemakers in history.

Accept the challenge.
