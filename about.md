### Who We Are
We represent a movement to improve the world through collaboration and social change. We believe it is our civic duty to improve our communities in any way possible - both for today and for the future.

We believe these improvements start with individual leadership and standing up for social change. We aim to follow in the footprints of Martin Luther King, Jr., Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, and the many other amazing individuals who stood up for righteousness in the face of extreme violence in order to spark social change.

### Our Mission

> To strengthen the social fabric of all communities through dedication to service, compassion, and empowerment.

We believe that the path to a better world starts with stronger social fabric in local communities. Social fabric, in this sense, means strong relationships amongst our neighbors, trustworthy public servants, and a mutual dedication to improving ourselves and the communities in which we live.

The social fabric of local communities can be strengthened through service, compassion, and empowerment.

#### Service
Service simply means we dedicate time and resources towards nurturing our communities.

- Volunteering our time to those less fortunate
- Pledging money to community initiatives like parks, roads, schools, neighborhood watch, etc
- Keeping our environment clean and healthy for ourselves and our future community
- Building a community conducive to innovation, collaboration, and trust

#### Compassion
Compassion means that we treat each other with dignity, courtesy, and respect. We have each other's backs, especially when things get tough.

- Seek to understand each other and perspectives that are different than our own
- Maintain a deep respect for human life - homelessness and starvation are entirely unnecessary
- Treat each other with loving kindness in all situations

#### Empowerment
Empowerment means giving members of the community the power to help themselves and the community achieve success.

- Respect basic human rights - food, shelter, freedom, security, etc.
- Support members of our society who cannot support themselves, with the end-goal of self-sufficiency whenever possible
- Equal opportunities for all - your race, nationality, religion, gender or amount of wealth should not prevent you from achieving success

### Social Fabric
Social fabric also stands for social awareness through branding and marketing, with a strong focus on clothing.  Just as each individual thread relies on the threads surrounding it to hold a shirt together, so does each individual in a community rely on those around them to hold the community together.

We help you share your message with the world through our network of socially conscious individuals who share our values.

We empower our customers with knowledge of important social issues and use effective branding and marketing techniques to inspire others to ask, "Hey, what's that about?"

You can do your part by simply wearing awesome, high-quality clothes representing powerful social movements and simply spread awareness to those who seek knowledge.
